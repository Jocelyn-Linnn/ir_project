Well, I want to thank everyone. This is quite a group. I have so many friends sitting right here. Oh, there's one that I -- he was calling me early on. He was saying why are you going through this process? You know he's going to win. He's big. He's strong. I will never fight you. I'm going to tell you that.

And he said every single thing that I was going to say. And what the hell? I can't say it again. But he's a special guy. He's been my friend for a long time. I probably shouldn't say a friend, but he is really a friend. He's a friend of the country. And I just want to thank Sean Hannity. He's a great guy.

And his ratings are very good, too, which is very important, which is very, very important. And you really do. You have incredible people at Fox.

they were thinking it was going to be close, and it wasn't close. We won the popular vote by millions and millions of votes. We won all seven swing states.

We had -- we had a tremendous -- just -- it was a tremendous day, a tremendous night, a tremendous period of time. Seventy-two days. It really started 72 days before. No day off, no play, no golf, no nothing. I didn't want to even play golf even though it's sort of a good thing to run through a course. [Audience member calls out "We love you, Mr. President."]

We ordered another 200, which is far more than I said we were going to do, but we ordered another 200. And I heard that they weren't going to use it because we had a very bad result in that election.

They tried, and then they just dropped their placards and went home. They said, "This is a slaughter." And -- but we're going to -- we're going to do things that have been really needed for a long time. And we are going to look at elections. We want to have paper ballots, one-day voting, voter ID, and proof of citizenship.

A little thing -- a little thing like proofs -- and we have a hard time because, you know, in California, they just passed a law that you're not even allowed to ask a voter for voter ID. Think of that. [Audience boos]

If you ask a voter for their voter ID, you've committed a crime. They have to get Judge Jeanine, where's Judge Jeanine, to lock them up.

We're going to get the whole country straightened out. And the first thing we have to do is get the criminals out of our country. They've allowed -- they've allowed 21 million people into our country coming through open borders from many, many countries. They came from jails. They came from mental institutions, insane asylums even.

We're going to get your prices down. Now, we're bringing the cost down. You know, when we were campaigning, a lot of people thought the biggest thing was the economy. And it is. It probably polled the best, but I never believed it was as important as immigration and the border and stopping our country from being invaded because this was a massive invasion of our country.

And I spoke with -- as you probably read, I spoke the other day to the president -- the new president of Mexico, very nice woman. And we had a very nice conversation. But she said, "Why are you doing this to me?" I said, "I'm not. I'm just putting a lot of tariffs on because you're allowing criminals to pour into our country, and we can't allow that anymore."

And -- and now, they're saying they're doing well. It's at -- it's at $3.75. But it was going up to $5, $6, $7, and $8. And they went back to the Trump plan. But the Trump plan, the real Trump plan would have had double the production that we have right now. And we're going to have that very shortly.
